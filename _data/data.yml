    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Torris Yin is an undergraduate student with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn). His research interest includes embedded hardware development and 5G communication, especially their applications in edge platform. 
      
      Since May 2023, he has been conducting research on 5G PHY Authentication and trying to verify related theories on the [USRP](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/wireless-design-test/what-is-a-usrp-software-defined-radio.html) platform. He is familiar with SDR OSS such as [OpenAirInterface](https://openairinterface.org) and [srsRAN Project](https://www.srslte.com) and have close communication with the open source community. 
      
      During his undergraduate years, he realized that there were huge flaws in the school's engineering education, which greatly affected students' professional abilities. Faced with this situation, he withstood tremendous pressure and founded the Aurora Project, which provides a set of engineering competency-building courses for undergraduates. This course clears away obstacles for students and helps them quickly embark on the road to becoming professional electronic engineers.
